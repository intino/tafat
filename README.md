# Tafat #

Tafat is a framework for building simulators based on a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. This development is supported by [Tara](https://bitbucket.org/siani/tara), a framework for building software based on MDE.

Tafat has been developed by [SIANI](http://www.siani.es) and is released under [GPL v3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

The simulation of power grids, cities and territories has been the most significant use cases that has been addressed using Tafat. A strong collaboration has been made with [EIFER](https://www.eifer.kit.edu/) and [EDF](https://www.edf.fr/) for developing use cases, defining requirements and supporting the evolution of this platform.
